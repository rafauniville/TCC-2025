# AI-Assisted Test Generation for React Components

This repository contains the source code, prompts, and evaluation materials used in an experimental study on AI-assisted test automation for React components.

## 📋 Project Overview

This study compares **GitHub Copilot** and **Windsurf** in the automated generation of unit tests, focusing on:

- ✅ Test coverage
- ⚙️ Development efficiency
- 🔧 Need for manual intervention

A **quantitative experimental design** was adopted, applying prompt engineering techniques such as **Chain of Thought** and **Self-Reflection** to guide the generation process.

## 🧪 Key Findings

- **Windsurf** achieved **higher average test coverage** (71.60%) but required more manual adjustments.
- **Copilot** delivered more **predictable and consistent outputs**, with fewer interventions.
- Both tools offer distinct trade-offs, and their effectiveness depends on the project context.
